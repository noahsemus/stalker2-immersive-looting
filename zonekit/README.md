# ImmersiveLooting — engineering log

What each kit check and each in-game test showed, newest at the bottom. Record dead ends here so they are never
retried. Plan: [../PLAN.md](../PLAN.md); reproducible edits: [../BUILD.md](../BUILD.md). Facts that hold for any
mod go to `harness/docs/` instead (promote them).

## 2026-10-09 — repo created from the harness
- `new_mod.ps1` created the repo, the kit plugin and the GitHub repo. GameFeatureData pending (tester picks the mod
  in the toolbar selector).
- Kit research (dumps, cfgs, uncooked assets read with a headless editor script, Nexus search, installed paks):
  `research/2026-10-09-pickup-and-left-hand-research.md`. Chosen route: NewContent host detects the pickup from the
  cached interaction target, plays a copy of the unused vanilla left-hand grab montage in `LeftHand`, flies a mesh
  copy of the item to `jnt_l_weapon`. See `../PLAN.md`.
